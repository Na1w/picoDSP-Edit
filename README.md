# PicoDSP Editor

Quick and dirty vibe coded patch editor and librarian for picoDSP 

As the picoDSP does not support live preview a local replica of the same audio engine is used to preview the patches toggled via (Remote / Local audio)

The sound engine uses infinitedsp-core, the UI is egui based.
